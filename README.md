# soxl_stock_prediction
I have created a machine learning model for one of my favorite stocks (or rather, ETFs): SOXL. This takes various different things as input, such as the trading days open price and closing price, to provide a prediction of what tomorrow's trading day will look like. This is the first ever real world model I have made.
The link to the site may be accessed here: https://mdsiam8.github.io/soxl_stock_prediction/.
Future plans are to:
-expand library of stocks that I cover
-achieve greater accuracy in the predictions
-create a webpage that allows a user to train their own ML model on their given stock, given that they have their own data
